Three treatment strategies are recommended. The stratified approach is based on headache severity: mild headaches are initially treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), whereas more severe headaches are initially treated with a triptan. In the “step care across attacks” approach, the initial medication is chosen based on cost and adverse effect profile. If treatment is unsuccessful, a more potent medication is used for subsequent attacks. Finally, the “step care within attacks” approach uses a simple analgesic initially, but switches to more potent medications later in the same attack, if necessary. In a comparative trial, the stratified approach was more successful at relieving pain at two hours, but it resulted in more adverse effects. The “step care within attacks” approach works best for prolonged episodes or in patients with inconsistent symptom patterns.

Guidelines stress basic treatment principles for acute migraine. First, the patient must understand the condition and treatment strategy, and medication should be taken early in the attack. Appropriate follow-up and treatment adjustment are crucial. Some patients require more than one medication or formulation. Several medications are available as tablets, orally disintegrating tablets, nasal sprays, or injections to facilitate administration, especially if vomiting occurs. Patients must be counseled about the danger of medication overuse and the risk of conversion to chronic daily headache (transformed migraine). Acute medications, including triptans, should not be used more than two or three times per week. If acute treatment is needed more often, prophylactic therapy should be considered.
