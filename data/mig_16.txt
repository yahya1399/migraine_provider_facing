First-Line Therapies
ACETAMINOPHEN AND NSAIDS
Strong evidence supports the use of acetaminophen and oral NSAIDs such as aspirin, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen as first-line treatments for mild to moderate migraine attacks. In placebo-controlled trials, acetaminophen was less effective than NSAIDs but did not cause gastric irritation or antiplatelet effects. The recommended dose is 1,000 mg. Aspirin is effective at doses of 1,000 mg but has the greatest risk of gastric irritation. Ibuprofen is often chosen for its availability and tolerability. A Cochrane review (nine studies, N = 4,373) comparing ibuprofen with placebo concluded that the number needed to treat (NNT) to improve pain from moderate/severe to mild at two hours is 3, and the NNT for complete pain relief at two hours is 7.17 Most studies used 400 mg of ibuprofen. Ibuprofen has a short half-life, and repeat dosing may be necessary. Diclofenac is available as a powder or tablet and is as effective as ibuprofen. Naproxen has a slower onset of action but longer half-life. Its NNT for partial pain relief at two hours is 7 and for complete pain relief at two hours is 10, but repeat dosing may not be required. The typical dose is 500 mg, but 825 mg may be slightly more effective. The combination of acetaminophen/aspirin/caffeine has strong evidence of effectiveness and can be used as a first-line treatment for migraine. Although trials consistently show NSAIDs to be more effective than placebo, head-to-head trials comparing NSAIDs are lacking, and the choice of NSAID should be based on availability and adverse effect profile.
