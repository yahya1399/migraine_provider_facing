Refractory Migraine
Parenteral dihydroergotamine (DHE 45) is commonly used to treat refractory migraine. However, vasoconstrictive agents should be avoided for 24 hours after administration of a triptan. In these cases, parenteral NSAIDs and/or antiemetics are preferred. Intravenous magnesium sulfate (1 to 2 g) may be an effective alternative treatment for migraine with aura. Intravenous valproate (Depacon) is commonly used, but the evidence supporting its effectiveness is contradictory. Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) is not recommended. Parenteral corticosteroids (e.g., intravenous dexamethasone) with or without tapered oral corticosteroids can be considered to help decrease headache recurrence. Opioids can be considered for refractory migraine but should be used sparingly and infrequently.
