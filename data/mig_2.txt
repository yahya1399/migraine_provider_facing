KEY CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTICE
1. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are a first-line treatment for mild to moderate migraine. The choice of medication should be based on availability and adverse effect profile.
2. Triptans are a first-line treatment for moderate to severe migraine. Several triptans are available with different pharmacokinetics and routes of administration.
3. The choice of triptan should be individualized based on the patient's migraine characteristics and on the route of administration, pharmacokinetics, and cost.
4. Dopamine antagonist antiemetics are second-line treatments for migraine.
5. Parenteral dihydroergotamine (DHE 45), magnesium sulfate, valproate (Depacon), and opioids should be reserved for refractory migraine because of adverse effects, weaker evidence of effectiveness, and/or abuse potential.
