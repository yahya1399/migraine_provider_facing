Diagnosis and Patient Assessment
Migraine has well-established diagnostic criteria. Good evidence supports the use of the POUND mnemonic for migraine diagnosis. Assessment aims to confirm diagnostic criteria, evaluate for alternative explanations, identify comorbidities that could complicate management (e.g., depression, chronic pain), and document the baseline pattern and severity of episodes. A variety of conditions can present as headache, most of which can be identified by the history and physical examination. The only indications for ancillary testing are to identify causes of secondary headaches or comorbid conditions. Red flag symptoms indicate the need for neuroimaging and/or urgent referral.
